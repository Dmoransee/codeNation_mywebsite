<h6>2.1</h6>
<p>
    The tools I used in making this blog were Trello (with the Kanban method) and Visual Studio.
    I am very happy with VS and find it intuitive to use.<br>
    I was intially unsure of Trello but have begun to rely on it more since it does seem to make use of the Kanban method quite effectivly.<br> 
    If I had to perform this project as part of a group I would have relied on Trello more heavily.

</p>
<h6>2.2</h6>
<p>
    I have only used Visual Studio for three weeks now but I can already tell that it is a piece of software that I would return to to write my own code in future projects.<br>
    As the project has continued I have used Trello increasingly, however I feel that it still lacks a way to separate tasks by their usefullness, a process which I currently achieve offline using an Eisenhower matrix.<br>
    It would be useful if I could find a way to incorporate the matrix into Trello.

    <!-- I am not yet completely satisfied with my website and I believe that there is a lot more that I could add to it in terms of appearence.
    For instance I would like to add a logo, images, and some eye catching graphics. -->
    There is obviously a lot more that I could do with the website.<br><br>

    Specifically I would liked to have added:<br>
    -cool backgrounds to each page.<br>
    -a navigation bar that highlights options as you move the mouse across it.<br>
    -a contact form that accepts input and responds.<br>
    -a website logo for each page.<br><br>

    That being said, I am happy with the fact that I did actually complete a website with five pages and content, and I would enjoy extending it if there was more time.
</p>
<h6>2.4</h6>
<p>
    <!--If continued my blog then I would like to add real functionality to it, instead of a dummy form I'd have a real form where visitors could submit messages which would be sent to my email. I'd also of course compare my blog to other blogs of consultants to find out what features are offered by other professional websites in the industry and take note.
    I think that most of my time would be spent researching ways to make the website as easy and as attractive for visitors to use, as well as designing it to be as effective at actually getting clients as it could possibly be.-->
