    Where as original purpose of IT was to simply assist businesses with issues like problem solving, decision making, marketing, customer support and management, IT has since become so useful to businesses in those regards that it is now difficult for a business to effectively compete in the market place without using IT.<br>
    A modern business will therefore make the most of any IT resources available.<br><br><br>

    Generally, the skills needed to complete a project are the abilities to plan, delegate, track, review and measure results. All projects differ but when business is involved the goal is always the same: to improve the business.<br><br>

    The methods I use to plan the creation of my websites are generally the following:<br><br>
    -Kanban method (on Trello)<br>
    -Time-boxing: I assign in advance the hours of my work day to specific tasks.<br>
    -A simple filing system: I keep record of any notes about specific pages or tasks, and I separate them from one another so that I can focus on the details of just one page/task at a time.<br>
    -Eisenhower matrix: I use this quadrant system to bring urgent tasks to the forefront of my workday.<br>
    -Setting personal time-contraints: This is a simple but effective method of getting tasks done that might otherwise drag on forever.<br><br>

    The most common types of risks faced during projects are:<br>
    -going over budget, such as when sinking costs into projects that are clearly not working.<br>
    -going over the estimated time-window, aka The Planning Fallacy.<br>
    -failure to deliver the end product<br><br>

    Other types of risk may include:<br>
    -legal risk, such as when a team faces legal action over their product or over their actions while developing the product.<br>
    -failure for a product to reach a market, which is generally because there was no such demand for the product in the first place. This type of risk can be avoided best by doing sufficient market research.<br><br>

    The simplest way to chose the systems and software I want to use is to ask myself what I want to achieve during the project.<br>
    This naturally leads on to further questions such as, 'What must the system or software be able to do?' and 'What problems must it help me solve?'.<br>
    Once I am aware of what I'm trying to do is is far easier to perform searches for the type of software I am looking for.<br><br>

    Next, I make a collection of softwares and then I might ask myself questions such as:<br>
    -Is this specific system/software more or less effective than another in getting me nearer my goal?<br>
    -Is it intuitive; will I be able to use this or learn to use this easily?<br><br>

Trello has helped me to split up the creation and delivery of the project into small tasks, each of which I can either quickly complete or split into subtasks if they prove to be difficult.<br>
Another use of Trello is as a reminder of what the overarching point of the current work is: not all tasks are equally productive, so being able to see on the todo list the essentials for project completion is a useful way of separating what must be done from what could be done.
<br><br>
Git and Github are useful in helping the authors of an evolving project from losing previous versions.<br>
While version control can be achieved by simply using folders, Github becomes essential once there are multiple authors working at once, and when project versions branch off for the purpose of testing.<br>
Tracking small changes that were made during the projects development and being able to annotate why (and by who) those changes were made is part of Githubs usefulness.<br>

    GDPR stands for General Data Protection Regulation and is a set of rules laid out by EU law which attempts to regulate how companies use and share data online.<br><br>

    The biggest impact of GDPR complience is that the targeting of digital product advertisments can no longer be as dependant upon the collecting of data about potential users as targeting was previously.<br>
    This obviously effects any marketing strategy that uses data collected about customers. <br><br>

    GDPR requires that the individuals consent to have their data gathered must now be 'active' as opposed to passive.<br><br>
    Example of active-consent:<br>
    -a user of any website must now be told on entry if the website uses cookies to store information about their visit.<br>
    -a website must ask users if they actually want to recieve emails or newsletters, if that user submits contact information.<br><br>

    GDPR is enforced by a maximum fine for infringement of Â£18 million or 4% of annual global turnover (whichever is greater).<br><br>
