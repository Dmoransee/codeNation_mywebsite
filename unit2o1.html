    There are many regulations that govern how websites must operate legally. However, the creator of any work is automatically given copyright protection under UK law, and this prevents others from copying your work wether free of charge or to make profit from it. This obviously works both ways: no one is allowed to take content from your website and present it as their own without permission, and neither can you take other peoples content and use it on your own website without their permission.<br><br>

    Business websites must comply with regulations such as:<br>
    .The Data Protection Act.<br>
    .The Equality Act 2010<br>
    .PECR: The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003<br>

    The Equality Act 2010 is an attempt to make sure that all users of any service, wether traditional or online have access to that service, regardless of their ability.
    According to the act, failure to provide a service to a disabled person that would normally be provided to other people is unlawful discrimination.
    For example, blind users use screen readers which read aloud information on webpages, so accordingly any images should be given 'equivalent alternative text' that a screen reader can read out.
    Another example of an accessibilty issue is that of users who for whatever reason are unable to use the keyboard and mouse: in such cases an accessible website would be to receive speech input from the user.<br><br>
