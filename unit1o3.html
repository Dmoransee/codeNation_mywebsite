    I absolutely could have been more efficient at making this website.
    At this stage I am unfamilar with the html and css languages and so everything I've done so far has been in imitation of what the instructor has shown me. If I was todo this a second time I would ope that I'd be able to recall how todo a lot of this without being shown and that itself would save a lot of time.
    My experience from the pervious project showed me that working as a team can be a very fast way to complete a project, specifically when solving and overcoming problems.
    I would much have prefered to do this project as a team effort rather than on my own.
</p>
<h6>3.2</h6>
<p>
    I could have been far more productive if I'd work as part of a team, and focusing on one specific part of the website at a time, rather than doing everything on my own and all at once.
    If I did this again I think that I could work much more efficiently by searching online for solutions to problems and refering to the examples from sites like w3schools. I do think however that even being to accuratly pinpoint problem is a skill in itself and that is something that I want to practice so that my work can become more efficient.
</p>
<h6>3.3</h6>
<p>
    As much as I would like to try a similar project again as part of a team, I also recognise that it is important to be able to take on and manage something like this completely on my own if need be. In order todo that I am definitely going to have to learn to use all the resources available to help me manage the workload and learn the html and css languages.
    If there is one thing that I would do differently next time, it would be that I would ask the intsructor for an example of a website project that I should be aiming to recreate. Although I have followed the coding examples given by the instructor I did not reach out to ask for examples of the looks and feel of the final project, trying to do it on my own. The downside to this is that I have spent a lot of time guessing as to what I should be creating and that itself has eaten up a lot of the time for the project.<br>
    So to improve productivity next time, I would ask for examples of similar completed projects.
</p>

    At this point I think that - as long as the only consequence to a failed test is spent time - I would simply run the code to see what happens.<br> 
    Similarly, I think that with any system that needs to perform some role in getting us from A to B, the best test is to actually try it out, see what happens, and see if it gets us any closer to our desired goal.
